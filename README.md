# VBA-challenge

the multiple year xlsm file was too big to upload to I uploaded the alphabetical testing workbook. The code and results are the same and I put screenshots of both in the repository.

I was unable to figure out the conditional formatting and second summary table. I worked with the instructor in office hours where I was given a reference to complete the assignment, and then I worked with a tutor where I received more reference code. I did not work with any peers on this assignment.

Even with the help I could not understand the conditional formatting and summary table.
