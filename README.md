# VBA-challenge

the .xlsm files are the workbooks with the same vba code. I am also submitting a .txt file with the same code.

I was unable to figure out the conditional formatting and second summary table. I worked with the instructor in office hours where I was given a reference to complete the assignent, and then I worked with a tutor where I recieved more reference code. I did not work with any peers on this assignment.

Even with the help I was unable to understand the conditional formatting and summary table.
